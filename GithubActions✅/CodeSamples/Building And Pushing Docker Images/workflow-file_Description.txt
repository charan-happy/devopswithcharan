The workflow above uses the Buildx Docker CLI plugin that gives users extended container build options with the BuildKit toolkit. The docker job has five steps:

1. Check out the repository code.
2. Use setup-qemu-action to add support for emulation and enable building against a wider range of platforms.
3. Use setup-buildx-action to install and set up Buildx
4. Login to DockerHub with login-action and fetch the login username and password from the secrets created in the Dockerfile
5. Build and push the Docker image while showing the output in the registry.
