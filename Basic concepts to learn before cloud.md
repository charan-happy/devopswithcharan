#### What is datacenter ?

- A data center is a physical location that stores computing machines and their related hardware equipment. It contains the computing infrastructure that IT systems require, such as servers, data storage drives, and network equipment. It is the physical facility that stores any company’s digital data.

**Benefits of Datacenter :**

- Data Replication across several machines for disaster recovery.
- Backup Power supplies to Manage Power outages .
- Temparature controlled facilities to extend the life of the equipment.
- Easier implementation of the security measures for compliance with data laws .

  **Types of Datacenters**

**1. Enterprise Datacenters (on-premise):**

- On-premises data centers are fully owned company data centers that store sensitive data and critical applications for that company. You set up the data center, manage its ongoing operations, and purchase and maintain the equipment.

  Benefits :

  - Better Security due to Internal risk Management .
  - Customization facility based on requirement.
 
Limitations :

- High cost to build and maintain.
- Demands to build multiple datacenters to avoid single point of failure.

**2. Managed Services Datacenter :**

- A datacenter that is managed by a third party that leases (rents out) the equipment and the infrastructure.

**3. colocation Datacenters (colo) :**

- Colocation facilities are large data center facilities in which you can rent space to store your servers, racks, and other computing hardware.
- The colocation center typically provides security and support infrastructure such as cooling and network bandwidth.

Benefits :

- Provides fixed monthly costs to house your hardware .
- You can also geographically distribute hardware to minimize latency and to be closer to your end users.

Limitations :

- It can be challenging to source colocation facilities across the globe and in different geographical areas you target.
- Costs could also add up quickly as you expand.

**4. Cloud Datacenters :**

- In a cloud data center, you can rent both space and infrastructure.
- Cloud providers maintain large data centers with full security and compliance.
- You can access this infrastructure by using different services that give you more flexibility in usage and payment.

Benefits :

- A cloud data center reduces both hardware investment and the ongoing maintenance cost of any infrastructure.
- It gives greater flexibility in terms of usage options, resource sharing, availability, and redundancy.

Limitations :

- The quality of your internet connection determines the user experience.
- Little control over your data means data can be less secure.
- High-end scalability means cloud deployment costs can skyrocket if the operations are left unmanaged.

**Datacenter Tiers :**

- Datacenter tiers are the ranking system that indicates the reliability and performance of datacenter infrastructure.
- The tier ranges from 1 to 4.
- The tiers are on the factors such as fault tolerance, service cost, uptime guarantee and redundancy of power and  cooling systems.
- **The uptime institute** is an independent organization that certifies datacenters according to this tiers classification.

**What is inside the datacenter ?**

There are two types of infrastructure is present in the datacenter. They are 1. IT infrastructure and 2. Support Infrastructure
1. IT Infrastructure :
   - Servers
   - Storage
   - Network

2. Support Infrastructure :
   - power subsystems
   - Uninteruptible power supplies (UPS)
   - Backup Generators
   - Ventilation and cooling equipment.
   - Fire suppression system
   - Building security systems

**Points to remember :**

- Roles can be assumed within AWS account or multiple AWS accounts.
- At a time only one role is assumed.
- Trusted entities to assume a role can be external  ( SAML/Web Identity ).
- Behind the scene AWS Security Token Service ( STS ) generates a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access AWS resources.
