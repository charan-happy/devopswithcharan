Feedback : It doesn't matter how much you know, how much you are answering matters
           you know each and every concept but you don't know how to apply it
           You should be having thorough troubleshooting skills
           Needs to have good networking knowledge, you are lacking even basics
           You must know whatever u mentioned in the resume
           you have to know about scripting
