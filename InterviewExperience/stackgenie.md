- I got an IM from the founder itself to attend an interview via linkedin
- interview got scheduled

Some of the questions they asked me in the interview are :
- Tell me about yourself ?
- What is the alternative name of helm in rancher ?
- dockerfiles for go and python
- what is difference between ARG and ENV
- what is the difference between CMD and Entrypoint and give me usecase of it
- how are you doing patching for containers
- if api-server is down and how will you troubleshoot it ?
- In rancher, how you build clusters
- How are you building infrastructure to the customers in rancher ?
- what are multistage builds and how are you going to build them ?


Feedback : Has to focus on fundamentals. Lacking in fundamentals. We need builders not supporters
