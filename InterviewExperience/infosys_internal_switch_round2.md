<details><summary>1. Please let me know about yourself ?</summary>I'm a DevOps Engineer with 4 years of hands-on experience in building CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, container orchestration, and cloud-native deployments. Iâ€™ve worked extensively with tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, Terraform, Ansible, and GitHub Actions. My recent focus has been on building scalable infra using Rancher (RKE2), integrating security and observability into pipelines, and automating the release lifecycle for microservices-based apps. I specialize in reducing deployment times and ensuring high availability by building developer-centric infrastructure with best practices. </details>
<details><summary>2. How would you rate yourself on a scale of 5 ?</summary> Linux: 5/5

CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins): 5/5

Terraform & Infra-as-Code: 4.5/5

Cloud (AWS, Azure): 4/5

Kubernetes (Rancher, Helm): 4.5/5

Scripting (Python, Bash): 4/5

Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana): 4.5/5

</details>
<details><summary>3. what are distroles images in docker ?</summary>Distroless images are minimal Docker base images that donâ€™t contain a package manager, shell, or other OS toolsâ€”only the application and its runtime. They are more secure and lightweight.

Use Case: For a Go app, using gcr.io/distroless/static cuts attack surface and reduces image size drastically </details>
<details><summary>4. write a docker file for python application ?</summary>FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["python", "app.py"] </details>
<details><summary>5. why you used CMD instead of Entrypoint ?</summary>CMD is used when I want the flexibility to override the command during runtime, like debugging or changing behavior. </details>
<details><summary>6. How they both differ ?</summary>CMD is overridden when a command is passed via docker run

ENTRYPOINT always executes unless explicitly overridden

Use Case: ENTRYPOINT for consistent startup logic; CMD for config defaults.

 </details>
<details><summary>7. How can you access the app ?</summary> By exposing a port in the Dockerfile (EXPOSE 8000) and mapping it to a host port:docker run -p 8080:8000 myapp</details>
<details><summary>8. which is one is container port and which one is host port ?</summary>In -p 8080:8000: 8080 is the host port, 8000 is the container port.</details>
<details><summary>9. Explain about CI/CD Pipeline setup ?</summary> </details>
<details><summary>10. How helm integrated ?</summary> Tools: GitHub Actions

CI: Lint, test, build Docker image, scan using Trivy

CD: Deploy to Kubernetes via Helm

Notifications via Slack/email</details>
<details><summary>11. How can you send email notification to the team after job finished ?</summary>Helm charts stored in Git repo

CI pushes image â†’ Helm upgrades deployed release
helm upgrade --install cloudnotes ./chart --values=values.yaml
</details>
<details><summary>12. write CI/CD pipeline (declarative) with multiple stages</summary>se mailx or sendmail

In GitHub Actions:
```
- name: Send email
  uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v3
```
</details>
<details><summary>13. Do you have separate Ci and CD pipelines or single pipeline ?</summary>name: CI-CD
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - run: docker build -t app .
      - run: trivy image app
  deploy:
    steps:
      - run: helm upgrade --install app ./chart 

Sometimes yes. CI runs on every push; CD is triggered after approval or on tag.
</details>

Feedback : You are good at horizontally has to be good at vertically . if i ask you multiple ways u can able to answer but when i go indepth of a particular tool. then u are fearing. learn one programming language get logic clear. cloud skills needs tobe polished

Finally selectedðŸŽ‰ðŸ”¥âœ…
