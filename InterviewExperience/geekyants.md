<details><summary>3. How SSH Authentication works ?</summary>2 types:

SH (Secure Shell) is a secure protocol used to remotely log into systems and perform administrative tasks. It's critical for DevOps engineers who manage cloud infrastructure, CI/CD systems, and automation scripts.

There are two primary authentication mechanisms in SSH:

‚úÖ 1. Password-based Authentication
How it works:

You run: ssh user@server

The server prompts: Password:

You manually enter the password.

If it matches the user credentials on the server, access is granted.

Risks:

Prone to brute-force attacks

If password is weak or reused, it's a major security risk

Not scalable for automated tasks (e.g., Ansible, CI/CD)

Usage:

Mostly used in non-production or legacy systems

Can be disabled on secure setups

‚úÖ 2. Key-based Authentication (Highly Preferred in DevOps)
üîß How it works:
You generate a key pair on your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
This creates:

~/.ssh/id_rsa (Private Key)

~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

You copy the public key to the remote server:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-copy-id user@server
Or manually add it to:

swift
Copy
Edit
/home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
When you try to SSH:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh user@server
The server checks if your private key matches a public key in authorized_keys.

If matched ‚Üí Encrypted challenge is solved locally using the private key.

Server grants access without asking for a password.

üîê Why is key-based authentication more secure?
Private keys are never transmitted over the network.

Can be protected with a passphrase.

Keys are long and random (almost impossible to brute-force).

Supports automation (used by Ansible, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.)

üìå Real-World Use Cases:
Use Case	Authentication Type	Why?
Cloud VM access (e.g., AWS EC2)	Key-based	AWS disables password login by default
Ansible deployments	Key-based	Required for non-interactive access
Jump server access	Key-based (often with MFA)	Hardened environments
CI/CD pipelines (SSH deploys)	Key-based	Required for automation
Bastion hosts	Key-based + IP whitelisting	Extra layer of control

üîê Optional Enhancements (Real-World):
SSH Agent Forwarding: For jumping across multiple servers without copying keys.

Key with Passphrase: Add extra protection if key is compromised.

Using ssh-agent: Store decrypted keys temporarily so you don‚Äôt re-enter passphrase.

üö´ Disable Password-based SSH (Best Practice):
Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the remote server:

ini
Copy
Edit
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin no
Then restart SSH:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart sshd
üß† Pro Tip (from experience):
Use ~/.ssh/config to simplify multiple remote connections:

ini
Copy
Edit
Host dev-server
  HostName 192.168.1.100
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/dev.pem
Then you can just do:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh dev-server
