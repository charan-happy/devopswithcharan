DevOps project to practice Docker & Kubernetes:

1. Install Docker and Kubernetes locally (Minikube or Kind for Kubernetes)
2. Create a simple Node.js application (or any other language)
3. Write a Dockerfile to containerize the application
4. Build and tag the Docker image locally
5. Push the Docker image to DockerHub or a private container registry
6. Create a Kubernetes Deployment YAML file for the application
7. Expose the Deployment using a Kubernetes Service
8. Deploy the application to Kubernetes with kubectl apply
9. Verify the application is running and accessible
10. Scale the Deployment to multiple replicas

Advanced:
1. Create a ConfigMap to store environment variables for the application
2. Use a Kubernetes Secret to store sensitive data (like database credentials)
3. Implement persistent storage with PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim
4. Configure a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to build, push, and deploy the image to Kubernetes
5. Integrate Ingress Controller for custom domain routing
6. Enable resource limits and requests for pods

This project covers essential and advanced practices for containerization and orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes.
