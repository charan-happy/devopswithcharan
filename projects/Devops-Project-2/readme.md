Practice #DevOps with this simple project:  

1. Find a simple three tier application (Frontend, Backend, Database)
2. Create Docker containers for all three components 
3. Create simple server (EC2 is free) and install Docker & nginx 
4. Create docker-compose to deploy all components at once 
5. Configure ports and expose containers locally 
6. Configure nginx to expose the frontend container  

Advanced: 
1. Automate deployment with GitHub Actions 
2. Secure ports on EC2 instance 
3. Configure custom domain and create SSL with certbot  

Doing this will cover basics of: #Docker, #AWS, #CICD and #nginx
